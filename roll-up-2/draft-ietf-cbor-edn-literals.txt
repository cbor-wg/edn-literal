                CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)
                  draft-ietf-cbor-edn-literals-latest

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949) is
   a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely
   small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without
   the need for version negotiation.

   In addition to the binary interchange format, CBOR from the outset
   (RFC 7049) defined a text-based "diagnostic notation" in order to be
   able to converse about CBOR data items without having to resort to
   binary data.  RFC 8610 extended this into what is known as Extended
   Diagnostic Notation (EDN).

   This document consolidates the definition of EDN, sets forth a
   further step of its evolution, and is intended to serve as a single
   reference target in specifications that use EDN.

   It specifies an extension point for adding application-oriented
   extensions to the diagnostic notation.  It then defines two such
   extensions that enhance EDN with text representations of epoch-based
   date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes (RFC 9164).

   A few further additions close some gaps in usability.  The document
   modifies one extension originally specified in Appendix G.4 of RFC
   8610 to enable further increasing usability.  To facilitate tool
   interoperation, this document specifies a formal ABNF grammar, and it
   adds media types.


   // (This "cref" paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The
   // present revision -13 reflects the branches "roll-up" and "roll-up-
   // 2" in the repository, an attempt to contain the entire
   // specification of EDN in this document, instead of describing
   // updates to the existing documents RFC 8949 and RFC 8610.
   // Editorial work on the branch "roll-up-2" might continue.  The
   // exact reflection of this document being a replacement for both
   // Section 8 of RFC 8949 and Appendix G of RFC 8610 needs to be
   // recorded in the metadata and in abstract and introduction.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949) is
   a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely
   small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without
   the need for version negotiation.

   In addition to the binary interchange format, CBOR from the outset
   (Section 6 of [RFC7049], now Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94]) defined a
   text-based "diagnostic notation" in order to be able to converse
   about CBOR data items without having to resort to binary data.
   Appendix G of [RFC8610] extended this into what is known as Extended
   Diagnostic Notation (EDN).

   Diagnostic notation syntax is based on JSON, with extensions for
   representing CBOR constructs such as binary data and tags.
   (Standardizing this together with the actual interchange format does
   not serve to create another interchange format, but enables the use
   of a shared diagnostic notation in tools for and in documents about
   CBOR.)

   This document consolidates the definition of EDN, sets forth a
   further step of its evolution, and is intended to serve as a single
   reference target in specifications that use EDN.

   It specifies an extension point for adding application-oriented
   extensions to the diagnostic notation.  It then defines two such
   extensions that enhance EDN with text representations of epoch-based
   date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes [RFC9164].

   A few further additions close some gaps in usability.  The document
   modifies one extension originally specified in Appendix G.4 of
   [RFC8610] to enable further increasing usability.  To facilitate tool
   interoperation, this document specifies a formal ABNF grammar.  (See
   Section 5.1 for an overall ABNF grammar as well as the ABNF
   definitions in Section 5.2 for grammars for both the byte string
   presentations predefined in [STD94] and the application-extensions
   defined here.)

   In addition, this document finally registers a media type identifier
   and a content-format for CBOR diagnostic notation.  This does not
   elevate its status as an interchange format, but recognizes that
   interaction between tools is often smoother if media types can be
   used.

      |  Examples in RFCs often do not use media type identifiers, but
      |  special sourcecode type names that are allocated in
      |  https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/sourcecode-types.txt
      |  (https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/sourcecode-types.txt).
      |  At the time of writing, this resource lists four sourcecode
      |  type names that can be used in RFCs for including CBOR data
      |  items and CBOR-related languages:
      |  
      |     *  cbor (which is actually not useful, as CBOR is a binary
      |        format and cannot be used in textual examples in an RFC),
      |  
      |     *  cbor-diag (which is another name for EDN, as defined in
      |        the present document),
      |  
      |     *  cbor-pretty (which is a possibly annotated and pretty-
      |        printed hexdump of an encoded CBOR data item, along the
      |        lines of the grammar of Section 5.2.1, as used for
      |        instance for some of the examples in Appendix A.3 of
      |        [RFC9290]), and
      |  
      |     *  cddl (which is used for the Concise Data Definition
      |        Language, CDDL, see Section 1.2 below).

   Note that EDN is not meant to be the only text-based representation
   of CBOR data items.  For instance, [YAML] [RFC9512] is able to
   represent most CBOR data items, possibly requiring use of YAML's
   extension points.  YAML does not provide certain features that can be
   useful with tools and documents needing text-based representations of
   CBOR data items (such as embedded CBOR or encoding indicators), but
   it does provide a host of other features that EDN does not provide
   such as anchor/alias data sharing, at a cost of higher implementation
   and learning complexity.

1.1.  Structure of This Document

   Section 2 of this document has been built from Section 8 of RFC 8949
   [STD94] and Appendix G of [RFC8610].  The latter provided a number of
   useful extensions to the diagnostic notation originally defined in
   Section 6 of [RFC7049].  Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94] and Appendix G
   of [RFC8610] have collectively been called "Extended Diagnostic
   Notation" (EDN), giving the present document its name.

   After introductory material, Section 3 introduces the concept of
   application-oriented extension literals and defines the "dt" and "ip"
   extensions.  Section 4 defines mechanisms for dealing with unknown
   application-oriented literals and deliberately elided information.
   Section 5 gives the formal syntax of EDN in ABNF, with explanations
   for some features of and additions to this syntax, as an overall
   grammar (Section 5.1) and specific grammars for the content of app-
   string and byte-string literals (Section 5.2).  This is followed by
   the conventional sections for IANA Considerations (6), Security
   considerations (7), and References (8.1, 8.2).  An informational
   comparison of EDN with CDDL follows in Appendix A.

1.2.  Terminology

   Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94] defines the original CBOR diagnostic
   notation, and Appendix G of [RFC8610] supplies a number of extensions
   to the diagnostic notation that result in the Extended Diagnostic
   Notation (EDN).  The diagnostic notation extensions include popular
   features such as embedded CBOR (encoded CBOR data items in byte
   strings) and comments.  A simple diagnostic notation extension that
   enables representing CBOR sequences was added in Section 4.2 of
   [RFC8742].  As diagnostic notation is not used in the kind of
   interchange situations where backward compatibility would pose a
   significant obstacle, there is little point in not using these
   extensions.

   Therefore, when we refer to "_diagnostic notation_", we mean to
   include the original notation from Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94] as
   well as the extensions from Appendix G of [RFC8610], Section 4.2 of
   [RFC8742], and the present document.  However, we stick to the
   abbreviation "_EDN_" as it has become quite popular and is more
   sharply distinguishable from other meanings than "DN" would be.

   In a similar vein, the term "ABNF" in this document refers to the
   language defined in [STD68] as extended in [RFC7405], where the
   "characters" of Section 2.3 of RFC 5234 [STD68] are Unicode scalar
   values.

   The term "CDDL" (Concise Data Definition Language) refers to the data
   definition language defined in [RFC8610] and its registered
   extensions (such as those in [RFC9165]), as well as
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-update-8610-grammar].  Additional information about
   the relationship between the two languages EDN and CDDL is captured
   in Appendix A.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] (RFC2119) (RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  (Non-)Objectives of this Document

   Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94] states the objective of defining a
   common human-readable diagnostic notation with CBOR.  In particular,
   it states:

   |  All actual interchange always happens in the binary format.

   One important application of EDN is the notation of CBOR data for
   humans: in specifications, on whiteboards, and for entering test
   data.  A number of features, such as comments inside prefixed string
   literals, are mainly useful for people-to-people communication via
   EDN.  Programs also often output EDN for diagnostic purposes, such as
   in error messages or to enable comparison (including generation of
   diffs via tools) with test data.

   For comparison with test data, it is often useful if different
   implementations generate the same (or similar) output for the same
   CBOR data items.  This is comparable to the objectives of
   deterministic serialization for CBOR data items themselves
   (Section 4.2 of RFC 8949 [STD94]).  However, there are even more
   representation variants in EDN than in binary CBOR, and there is
   little point in specifically endorsing a single variant as
   "deterministic" when other variants may be more useful for human
   understanding, e.g., the << >> notation as opposed to h''; an EDN
   generator may have quite a few options that control what presentation
   variant is most desirable for the application that it is being used
   for.

   Because of this, a deterministic representation is not defined for
   EDN, and there is no expectation for "roundtripping" from EDN to CBOR
   and back, i.e., for an ability to convert EDN to binary CBOR and back
   to EDN while achieving exactly the same result as the original input
   EDN — the original EDN possibly was created by humans or by a
   different EDN generator.

   However, there is a certain expectation that EDN generators can be
   configured to some basic output format, which:

   *  looks like JSON where that is possible;

   *  inserts encoding indicators only where the binary form differs
      from preferred encoding;

   *  uses hexadecimal representation (h'') for byte strings, not b64''
      or embedded CBOR (<<>>);

   *  does not generate elaborate blank space (newlines, indentation)
      for pretty-printing, but does use common blank spaces such as
      after , and :.

   Additional features such as ensuring deterministic map ordering
   (Section 4.2 of RFC 8949 [STD94]) on output, or even deviating from
   the basic configuration in some systematic way, can further assist in
   comparing test data.  Information obtained from a CDDL model can help
   in choosing application-oriented literals or specific string
   representations such as embedded CBOR or b64'' in the appropriate
   places.

2.  Overview over CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)

   CBOR is a binary interchange format.  To facilitate documentation and
   debugging, and in particular to facilitate communication between
   entities cooperating in debugging, this document defines a simple
   human-readable diagnostic notation.  All actual interchange always
   happens in the binary format.

   Note that diagnostic notation truly was designed as a diagnostic
   format; it originally was not meant to be parsed.  Therefore, no
   formal definition (as in ABNF) was given in the original documents.
   Recognizing that formal grammars can aid interoperation of tools and
   usability of documents that employ EDN, Section 5 now provides ABNF
   definitions.

   EDN is a true superset of JSON as it is defined in [STD90] in
   conjunction with [RFC7493] (that is, any interoperable [RFC7493] JSON
   text also is an EDN text), extending it both to cover the greater
   expressiveness of CBOR and to increase its usability.

   EDN borrows the JSON syntax for numbers (integer and floating-point,
   Section 2.3), certain simple values (Section 2.7), UTF-8 [STD63] text
   strings, arrays, and maps (maps are called objects in JSON; the
   diagnostic notation extends JSON here by allowing any data item in
   the map key position).

   As EDN is used for truly diagnostic purposes, its implementations MAY
   support generation and possibly ingestion of EDN for CBOR data items
   that are well-formed but not valid.  It is RECOMMENDED that an
   implementation enables such usage only explicitly by an API flag.

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   Validity of CBOR data items is discussed in Section 5.3 of RFC 8949
   [STD94], with basic validity discussed in Section 5.3.1 of RFC 8949
   [STD94], and tag validity discussed in Section 5.3.2 of RFC 8949
   [STD94].  Tag validity is more likely a subject for individual
   application-oriented extensions, while the two cases of basic
   validity (for text strings and for maps) are addressed in Sections
   2.4.5 and 2.5.2 under the heading of _validity_.

   The rest of this section provides an overview over specific features
   of EDN, starting with certain common syntactical features and then
   going through kinds of CBOR data items roughly in the order of CBOR
   major types.  Any additional detailed syntax discussion needed has
   been deferred to Section 5.1.

2.1.  Comments

   For presentation to humans, EDN text may benefit from comments.  JSON
   famously does not provide for comments, and the original diagnostic
   notation in Section 6 of [RFC7049] inherited this property.

   EDN now provides two comment syntaxes, which can be used where the
   syntax allows blank space (outside of constructs such as numbers,
   string literals, etc.):

   *  inline comments, delimited by slashes ("/"):

      In a position that allows blank space, any text within and
      including a pair of slashes is considered blank space (and thus
      effectively a comment).

   *  end-of-line comments, delimited by "#" and an end of line (LINE
      FEED, U+000A):

      In a position that allows blank space, any text within and
      including a pair of a "#" and the end of the line is considered
      blank space (and thus effectively a comment).

   Comments can be used to annotate a CBOR structure as in:

   /grasp-message/ [/M_DISCOVERY/ 1, /session-id/ 10584416,
                    /objective/ [/objective-name/ "opsonize",
                                 /D, N, S/ 7, /loop-count/ 105]]

   or, combining the use of inline and end-of-line comments:

2.2.  Encoding Indicators

   Sometimes it is useful to indicate in the diagnostic notation which
   of several alternative representations were actually used; for
   example, a data item written >1.5< by a diagnostic decoder might have
   been encoded as a half-, single-, or double-precision float.

   The convention for encoding indicators is that anything starting with
   an underscore and all immediately following characters that are
   alphanumeric or underscore is an encoding indicator, and can be
   ignored by anyone not interested in this information.  For example, _
   or _3.  Encoding indicators are always optional.

   (In the following, an abbreviation of the form ai=nn gives nn as the
   numeric value of the field _additional information_, the low-order 5
   bits of the initial byte: see Section 3 of RFC 8949 [STD94].)

   An underscore followed by a decimal digit n indicates that the
   preceding item (or, for arrays and maps, the item starting with the
   preceding bracket or brace) was encoded with an additional
   information value of ai=24+n.  For example, 1.5_1 is a half-precision
   floating-point number, while 1.5_3 is encoded as double precision.

   The encoding indicator _ is an abbreviation of what would in full
   form be _7, which is not used.  Therefore, an underscore _ on its own
   stands for indefinite length encoding (ai=31).  (Note that this
   encoding indicator is only available behind the opening brace/bracket
   for map and array (Section 2.5.1): strings have a special syntax
   streamstring for indefinite length encoding except for the special
   cases ''_ and ""_ (Section 2.4.2).)

   The encoding indicators _0 to _3 can be used to indicate ai=24 to
   ai=27, respectively.

   Surprisingly, Section 8.1 of RFC 8949 [STD94] does not address ai=0
   to ai=23 — the assumption seems to have been that preferred
   serialization (Section 4.1 of RFC 8949 [STD94]) will be used when
   converting CBOR diagnostic notation to an encoded CBOR data item, so
   leaving out the encoding indicator for a data item with a preferred
   serialization will implicitly use ai=0 to ai=23 if that is possible.
   The present specification allows making this explicit:

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   _i ("immediate") stands for encoding with ai=0 to ai=23.

   While no pressing use for further values for encoding indicators
   comes to mind, this is an extension point for EDN; Section 6.2
   defines a registry for additional values.

   Encoding Indicators are discussed in further detail in Section 2.4.2
   for indefinite length strings and in Section 2.5.1 for arrays and
   maps.

2.3.  Numbers

   In addition to JSON's decimal number literals, EDN provides
   hexadecimal, octal, and binary number literals in the usual
   C-language notation (octal with 0o prefix present only).

   The following are equivalent:

      4711
      0x1267
      0o11147
      0b1001001100111

   As are:

      1.5
      0x1.8p0
      0x18p-4

   Numbers composed only of digits (of the respective base) are
   interpreted as CBOR integers (major type 0/1, or where the number
   cannot be represented in this way, major type 6 with tag 2/3).  A
   leading "+" sign is a no-op, and a leading "-" sign inverts the sign
   of the number.  So 0, 000, +0 all represent the same integer zero, as
   does -0; 1, 001, +1 and +0001 all stand for the same integer one, and
   -1 and -0001 both designate the same integer minus one.

   Using a decimal point (.) and/or an exponent (e for decimal, p for
   hexadecimal) turns the number into a floating point number (major
   type 7) instead, irrespective of whether it is an integral number
   mathematically.  Note that, in floating point numbers, 0.0 is not the
   same number as -0.0, even if they are mathematically equal.

   The non-finite floating-point numbers Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN
   are written exactly as in this sentence (this is also a way they can
   be written in JavaScript, although JSON does not allow them).

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   See Section 5.1, Paragraph 7, Item 3 for additional details of the
   EDN number syntax.

   (Note that literals for further number formats, e.g., for
   representing rational numbers as fractions, or for NaNs with non-zero
   payloads, can be added as application-oriented literals.  Background
   information beyond that in [STD94] about the representation of
   numbers in CBOR can be found in the informational document
   [I-D.bormann-cbor-numbers].)

2.4.  Strings

   CBOR distinguishes two kinds of strings: text strings (the bytes in
   the string constitute UTF-8 [STD63] text, major type 3), and byte
   strings (CBOR does not further characterize the bytes that constitute
   the string, major type 2).

   EDN notates text strings in a form compatible to that of notating
   text strings in JSON (i.e., as a double-quoted string literal), with
   a number of usability extensions.  In JSON, no control characters are
   allowed to occur directly in text string literals; if needed, they
   can be specified using escapes such as \t or \r.  In EDN, string
   literals additionally can contain newlines (LINEFEED U+000A), which
   are copied into the resulting string like other characters in the
   string literal.  To deal with variability in platform presentation of
   newlines, any carriage return characters (U+000D) that may be present
   in the EDN string literal are not copied into the resulting string
   (see Section 5.1, Paragraph 7, Item 2).  No other control characters
   can occur directly in a string literal, and the handling of escaped
   characters (\r etc.) is as in JSON.

   JSON's escape scheme for characters that are not on Unicode's basic
   multilingual plane (BMP) is cumbersome.  EDN keeps it, but also adds
   the syntax \u{NNN} where NNN is the Unicode scalar value as a
   hexadecimal number.  This means the following are equivalent (the
   first o is escaped as \u{6f} for no particular reason):

   "D\u{6f}mino's \u{1F073} + \u{2318}"   # \u{}-escape 3 chars
   "Domino's \uD83C\uDC73 + \u2318"       # escape JSON-like
   "Domino's 🁳 + ⌘"                       # unescaped

   EDN adds a number of ways to notate byte strings, some of which
   provide detailed access to the bits within those bytes (see
   Section 2.4.3).  However, quite often, byte strings carry bytes that
   can be meaningfully notated as UTF-8 text.  Analogously to text
   string literals delimited by double quotes, EDN allows the use of
   single quotes (without a prefix) to express byte string literals with
   UTF-8 text; for instance, the following are equivalent:



Bormann                    Expires 7 May 2025                  [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   'hello world'
   h'68656c6c6f20776f726c64'

   The escaping rules of JSON strings are applied equivalently for text-
   based byte string literals, e.g., \\ stands for a single backslash
   and \' stands for a single quote.  (See Section 5.1, Paragraph 7,
   Item 7 for details.)

2.4.1.  Prefixed String Literals

   Single-quoted string literals can be prefixed by a sequence of ASCII
   letters and digits, starting with a letter, and using either lower
   case or upper case throughout. >false<, >true<, >null<, and
   >undefined< cannot be used as such prefixes.  This means that the
   text string value (the "content") of the single-quoted string literal
   is not used directly as a byte string, but is further processed in a
   way that is defined by the meaning given to the prefix.  Depending on
   the prefix, the result of that processing can, but need not be, a
   byte string value.

   Prefixed string literals (which are always single-quoted after the
   prefix) are used both for base-encoded byte string literals (see
   Section 2.4.3) and for application-oriented extension literals (see
   Section 3, called app-string).  (Additional base-encoded string
   literals can be defined as application-oriented extension literals by
   registering their prefixes; there is no fundamental difference
   between the two predefined base-encoded string literal prefixes (h,
   b64) and any such potential future extension literal prefixes.)

2.4.2.  Encoding Indicators of Strings

   The detailed chunk structure of byte and text strings encoded with
   indefinite length can be notated in the form (_ h'0123', h'4567') and
   (_ "foo", "bar").  However, for an indefinite-length string with no
   chunks inside, (_ ) would be ambiguous as to whether a byte string
   (encoded 0x5fff) or a text string (encoded 0x7fff) is meant and is
   therefore not used.  The basic forms ''_ and ""_ can be used instead
   and are reserved for the case of no chunks only --- not as short
   forms for the (permitted, but not really useful) encodings with only
   empty chunks, which need to be notated as (_ ''), (_ ""), etc., to
   preserve the chunk structure.

2.4.3.  Base-Encoded Byte String Literals

   Besides the unprefixed byte string literals that are analogous to
   JSON text string literals, EDN provides base-encoded byte string
   literals.  These are notated as prefixed string literals that carry
   one of the base encodings [RFC4648], without padding, i.e., the base
   encoding is enclosed in a single-quoted string literal, prefixed by
   >h< for base16 or >b64< for base64 or base64url (the actual encodings
   of the latter do not overlap, so the string remains unambiguous).
   For example, the byte string consisting of the four bytes 12 34 56 78
   (given in hexadecimal here) could be written h'12345678' or
   b64'EjRWeA'.

   (Note that Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94] also mentions >b32< for
   base32 and >h32< for base32hex.  This has not been implemented widely
   and therefore is not directly included in this specification.  These
   and further byte string formats now can easily be added back as
   application-oriented extension literals.)

   Examples often benefit from some blank space (spaces, line breaks) in
   byte strings.  In EDN, blank space is ignored in prefixed byte
   strings; for instance, the following are equivalent:

      h'48656c6c6f20776f726c64'
      h'48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64'
      h'4 86 56c 6c6f
        20776 f726c64'

   Note that the internal syntax of prefixed single-quote literals such
   as h'' and b64'' can allow comments as blank space (see Section 2.1).
   Since slash characters are allowed in b64'', only inline comments are
   available in b64 string literals.

      h'68656c6c6f20776f726c64'
      h'68 65 6c /doubled l!/ 6c 6f # hello
        20 /space/
        77 6f 72 6c 64' /world/

2.4.4.  Embedded CBOR and CBOR Sequences in Byte Strings

   Where a byte string is to carry an embedded CBOR-encoded item, or
   more generally a sequence of zero or more such items, the diagnostic
   notation for these zero or more CBOR data items, separated by commas,
   can be enclosed in << and >> to notate the byte string resulting from
   encoding the data items and concatenating the result.  For instance,
   each pair of columns in the following are equivalent:





Bormann                    Expires 7 May 2025                  [Page 14]

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


      <<1>>              h'01'
      <<1, 2>>           h'0102'
      <<"hello", null>>  h'65 68656c6c6f f6'
      <<>>               h''

2.4.5.  Validity of Text Strings

   To be valid CBOR, Section 5.3.1 of RFC 8949 [STD94] requires that
   text strings are byte sequences in UTF-8 [STD63] form.  EDN provides
   several ways to construct such byte strings (see Section 5.1,
   Paragraph 7, Item 7 for details).  These mechanisms might operate on
   subsequences that do not themselves constitute UTF-8, e.g., by
   building larger sequences out of concatenating the subsequences; for
   validity of a text string resulting from these mechanisms it is only
   of importance that the result is UTF-8.  Both double-quoted and
   single-quoted string literals have been defined such that they lead
   to byte sequences that are UTF-8: the source language of EDN is UTF-
   8, and all escaping mechanisms lead only to adding further UTF-8
   characters.  Only prefixed string literals can generate non-UTF-8
   byte sequences.

2.5.  Arrays and Maps

   EDN borrows the JSON syntax for arrays and maps.  (Maps are called
   objects in JSON.)

   For maps, EDN extends the JSON syntax by allowing any data item in
   the map key position (before the colon).

   JSON requires the use of a comma as a separator character between the
   elements of an array as well as between the members (key/value pairs)
   of a map.  (These commas also were required in the original
   diagnostic notation defined in [STD94] and [RFC8610].)  The separator
   commas are now optional in the places where EDN syntax allows commas.
   (Stylistically, leaving out the commas is more idiomatic when they
   occur at line breaks.)

   In addition, EDN also allows, but does not require, a trailing comma
   before the closing bracket/brace, enabling an easier to maintain
   "terminator" style of their use.

   In summary, the following eight examples are all equivalent:

   # etc.

      |  groups) are entirely optional (and actually are terminators,
      |  which together with their optionality allows them to be used
      |  like separators as well, or even not at all).  In summary,
      |  comma use is now aligned between EDN and CDDL, in a fully
      |  backwards compatible way.

2.5.1.  Encoding Indicators of Arrays and Maps

   A single underscore can be written after the opening brace of a map
   or the opening bracket of an array to indicate that the data item was
   represented in indefinite-length format.  For example, [_ 1, 2]
   contains an indicator that an indefinite-length representation was
   used to represent the data item [1, 2].

2.5.2.  Validity of Maps

   As discussed at the start of Section 2, EDN implementations MAY
   support generation and possibly ingestion of EDN for CBOR data items
   that are well-formed but not valid.

   For maps, this is relevant for map keys that occur more than once, as
   in:

   {1: "to", 1: "fro"}

2.6.  Tags

   A tag is written as a decimal unsigned integer for the tag number,
   followed by the tag content in parentheses; for instance, a date in
   the format specified by RFC 3339 (ISO 8601) could be notated as:

   or the equivalent epoch-based time as the following:

        1(1363896240)

2.7.  Simple values

   EDN uses JSON syntax for the simple values True (>true<), False
   (>false<), and Null (>null<).  Undefined is written >undefined< as in
   JavaScript.

   Other simple values are given as "simple()" with the appropriate
   integer in the parentheses.  For example, >simple(42)< indicates
   major type 7, value 42.

3.  Application-Oriented Extension Literals

   This document extends the syntax used in diagnostic notation for byte
   string literals to also be available for application-oriented
   extensions.

   As per Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94], the diagnostic notation can
   notate byte strings in a number of [RFC4648] base encodings, where
   the encoded text is enclosed in single quotes, prefixed by an
   identifier (»h« for base16, »b32« for base32, »h32« for base32hex,
   »b64« for base64 or base64url).

   This syntax can be thought to establish a name space, with the names
   "h", "b32", "h32", and "b64" taken, but other names being
   unallocated.  The present specification defines additional names for
   this namespace, which we call _application-extension identifiers_.
   For the quoted string, the same rules apply as for byte strings.  In
   particular, the escaping rules that were adapted from JSON strings
   are applied equivalently for application-oriented extensions, e.g.,
   within the quoted string \\ stands for a single backslash and \'
   stands for a single quote.

   An application-extension identifier is a name consisting of a lower-
   case ASCII letter (a-z) and zero or more additional ASCII characters
   that are either lower-case letters or digits (a-z0-9).

   Application-extension identifiers are registered in a registry
   (Section 6.1).

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   Prefixing a single-quoted string, an application-extension identifier
   is used to build an application-oriented extension literal, which
   stands for a CBOR data item the value of which is derived from the
   text given in the single-quoted string using a procedure defined in
   the specification for an application-extension identifier.

   An application-extension (such as dt) MAY also define the meaning of
   a variant prefix built out of the application-extension identifier by
   replacing each lower-case character by its upper-case counterpart
   (such as DT), for building an application-oriented extension literal
   using that all-uppercase variant as the prefix of a single-quoted
   string.

   As a convention for such definitions, using the all-uppercase variant
   implies making use of a tag appropriate for this application-oriented
   extension (such as tag number 1 for DT).

   Examples for application-oriented extensions to CBOR diagnostic
   notation can be found in the following sections.

3.1.  The "dt" Extension

   The application-extension identifier "dt" is used to notate a date/
   time literal that can be used as an Epoch-Based Date/Time as per
   Section 3.4.2 of RFC 8949 [STD94].

   The text of the literal is a Standard Date/Time String as per
   Section 3.4.1 of RFC 8949 [STD94].

   The value of the literal is a number representing the result of a
   conversion of the given Standard Date/Time String to an Epoch-Based
   Date/Time.  If fractional seconds are given in the text (production
   time-secfrac in Figure 4), the value is a floating-point number; the
   value is an integer number otherwise.  In the all-upper-case variant
   of the app-prefix, the value is enclosed in a tag number 1.

   As an example, the CBOR diagnostic notation

   dt'1969-07-21T02:56:16Z',
   dt'1969-07-21T02:56:16.5Z',
   DT'1969-07-21T02:56:16Z'

   is equivalent to

   -14159024,
   -14159023.5,
   1(-14159024)

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   See Section 5.2.3 for an ABNF definition for the content of dt
   literals.

3.2.  The "ip" Extension

   The application-extension identifier "ip" is used to notate an IP
   address literal that can be used as an IP address as per Section 3 of
   [RFC9164].

   The text of the literal is an IPv4address or IPv6address as per
   Section 3.2.2 of [RFC3986].

   With the lower-case app-string prefix ip, the value of the literal is
   a byte string representing the binary IP address.  With the upper-
   case app-string prefix IP, the literal is such a byte string tagged
   with tag number 54, if an IPv6address is used, or tag number 52, if
   an IPv4address is used.

   As an additional case, the upper-case app-string prefix IP'' can be
   used with an IP address prefix such as 2001:db8::/56 or 192.0.2.0/24,
   with the equivalent tag as its value.  (Note that [RFC9164]
   representations of address prefixes need to implement the truncation
   of the address byte string as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC9164];
   see example below.)  For completeness, the lower-case variant
   ip'2001:db8::/56' or ip'192.0.2.0/24' stands for an unwrapped
   [56,h'20010db8'] or [24,h'c00002']; however, in this case the
   information on whether an address is IPv4 or IPv6 often needs to come
   from the context.

   Note that there is no direct representation of the "Interface format"
   defined in Section 3.1.3 of [RFC9164], an address combined with an
   optional prefix length and an optional zone identifier.  This can be
   represented as in 52([ip'192.0.2.42',24]), if needed.

   Examples: the CBOR diagnostic notation

   ip'192.0.2.42',
   IP'192.0.2.42',
   IP'192.0.2.0/24',
   ip'2001:db8::42',
   IP'2001:db8::42',
   IP'2001:db8::/64'

   is equivalent to

   literals.

4.  Stand-in Representations in Binary CBOR

   In some cases, an EDN consumer cannot construct actual CBOR items
   that represent the CBOR data intended for eventual interchange.  This
   document defines stand-in representation for two such cases:

   *  The EDN consumer does not know (or does not implement) an
      application-extension identifier used in the EDN document
      (Section 4.1) but wants to preserve the information for a later
      processor.

   *  The generator of some EDN intended for human consumption (such as
      in a specification document) may not want to include parts of the
      final data item, destructively replacing complete subtrees or
      possibly just parts of a lengthy string by _elisions_
      (Section 4.2).

   Implementation note: Typically, the ultimate applications will fail
   if they encounter tags unknown to them, which the ones defined in
   this section likely are.  Where chains of tools are involved in
   processing EDN, it may be useful to fail earlier than at the ultimate
   receiver in the chain unless specific processing options (e.g.,
   command line flags) are given that indicate which of these stand-ins
   are expected at this stage in the chain.

4.1.  Handling unknown application-extension identifiers

   When ingesting CBOR diagnostic notation, any application-oriented
   extension literals are usually decoded and transformed into the
   corresponding data item during ingestion.  If an application-
   extension is not known or not implemented by the ingesting process,
   this is usually an error and processing has to stop.

   However, in certain cases, it can be desirable to exceptionally carry

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   This specification defines a CBOR Tag for this purpose: The
   Diagnostic Notation Unresolved Application-Extension Tag, tag number
   CPA999 (Section 6.5).  The content of this tag is an array of two
   text strings: The application-extension identifier, and the (escape-
   processed) content of the single-quoted string.  For example,
   dt'1969-07-21T02:56:16Z' can be provisionally represented as /CPA/
   999(["dt", "1969-07-21T02:56:16Z"]).

   If a stage of ingestion is not prepared to handle the Unresolved
   Application-Extension Tag, this is an error and processing has to
   stop, as if this stage had been ingesting an unknown or unimplemented
   application-extension literal itself.


   // RFC-Editor: This document uses the CPA (code point allocation)
   // convention described in [I-D.bormann-cbor-draft-numbers].  For
   // each usage of the term "CPA", please remove the prefix "CPA" from
   // the indicated value and replace the residue with the value
   // assigned by IANA; perform an analogous substitution for all other
   // occurrences of the prefix "CPA" in the document.  Finally, please
   // remove this note.

4.2.  Handling information deliberately elided from an EDN document

   When using EDN for exposition in a document or on a whiteboard, it is
   often useful to be able to leave out parts of an EDN document that
   are not of interest at that point of the exposition.

   To facilitate this, this specification supports the use of an
   _ellipsis_ (notated as three or more dots in a row, as in ...) to
   indicate parts of an EDN document that have been elided (and
   therefore cannot be reconstructed).

   Upon ingesting EDN as a representation of a CBOR data item for
   further processing, the occurrence of an ellipsis usually is an error
   and processing has to stop.

   However, it is useful to be able to process EDN documents with
   ellipses in the automation scripts for the documents using them.
   This specification defines a CBOR Tag that can be used in the
   ingestion for this purpose: The Diagnostic Notation Ellipsis Tag, tag
   number CPA888 (Section 6.5).  The content of this tag either is

   1.  null (indicating a data item entirely replaced by an ellipsis),
       or it is

   2.  an array, the elements of which are alternating between fragments
       of a string and the actual elisions, represented as ellipses
       carrying a null as content.

   Elisions can stand in for entire subtrees, e.g. in:

   [1, 2, ..., 3]
   { "a": 1,
     "b": ...,
     ...: ...
   }

   A single ellipsis (or key/value pair of ellipses) can imply eliding
   multiple elements in an array (members in a map); if more detailed
   control is required, a data definition language such as CDDL can be
   employed.  (Note that the stand-in form defined here does not allow
   multiple key/value pairs with an ellipsis as a key: the CBOR data
   item would not be valid.)

   Subtree elisions can be represented in a CBOR data item by using
   /CPA/888(null) as the stand-in:

   [1, 2, 888(null), 3]
   { "a": 1,
     "b": 888(null),
     888(null): 888(null)
   }

   Elisions also can be used as part of a (text or byte) string:

   { "contract": "Herewith I buy" + ... + "gned: Alice & Bob",
     "signature": h'4711...0815',
   }

   The example "contract" combines string concatenation via the +
   operator (Section 5.1) with ellipses; while the example "signature"
   uses special syntax that allows the use of ellipses between the bytes
   notated _inside_ h'' literals.

   String elisions can be represented in a CBOR data item by a stand-in
   that wraps an array of string fragments alternating with ellipsis
   indicators:

   { "contract": /CPA/888(["Herewith I buy", 888(null),
                           "gned: Alice & Bob"]),
     "signature": 888([h'4711', 888(null), h'0815']),
   }

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   Note that the use of elisions is different from "commenting out" EDN
   text, e.g.:

   { "signature": h'4711/.../0815',
     # ...: ...
   }

   The consumer of this EDN will ignore the comments and therefore will
   have no idea after ingestion that some information has been elided;
   validation steps may then simply fail instead of being informed about
   the elisions.

5.  ABNF Definitions

   This section collects grammars in ABNF form ([STD68] as extended in
   [RFC7405]) that serve to define the syntax of EDN and some
   application-oriented literals.

   Implementation note: The ABNF definitions in this section are
   intended to be useful in a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) parser
   interpretation (see Appendix A of [RFC8610] for an introduction into
   PEG).

5.1.  Overall ABNF Definition for Extended Diagnostic Notation

   This subsection provides an overall ABNF definition for the syntax of
   CBOR extended diagnostic notation.

      |  This ABNF definition treats all single-quoted strings the same,
      |  whether they are unprefixed and constitute byte string
      |  literals, or prefixed and their content subject to further
      |  processing.  The text string value of the single-quoted strings
      |  that goes into that further processing is described using
      |  separate ABNF definitions in Section 5.2; as a convention, the
      |  grammar for the content of an app-stringwith prefix, say,p, is
      |  described by an ABNF definition with the rule nameapp-string-
      |  p`.
      |  
      |  As an implementation note, some implementations may want to
      |  integrate the parsing and processing of app-string content with
      |  the overall grammar.  Such an integrated syntax is not defined
      |  in this specification, but it can be derived from the overall
      |  ABNF definition and the prefix-specific app-string ABNF
      |  definitions by mechanically replacing each character in the
      |  app-string definition in Section 5.2 by the ways that character
      |  can be represented in the overall ABNF.
      |  
      |  E.g., the rules

   While an ABNF grammar defines the set of character strings that are
   considered to be valid EDN by this ABNF, the mapping of these
   character strings into the generic data model of CBOR is not always
   obvious.

   The following additional items should help in the interpretation:

   *  As mentioned in the terminology (Section 1.2), the ABNF terminal
      values in this document define Unicode scalar values (characters)
      rather than their UTF-8 encoding.  For example, the Unicode PLACE
      OF INTEREST SIGN (U+2318) would be defined in ABNF as %x2318.

   *  Unicode CARRIAGE RETURN (U+000D, often seen escaped as "\r" in
      many programming languages) that exist in the input (unescaped)
      are ignored as if they were not in the input wherever they appear.
      This is most important when they are found in (text or byte)
      string contexts (see the "unescaped" ABNF rule).  On some
      platforms, a carriage return is always added in front of a LINE
      FEED (U+000A, also often seen escaped as "\n" in many programming
      languages), but on other platforms, carriage returns are not used
      at line breaks.  The intent behind ignoring unescaped carriage
      returns is to ensure that input generated or processed on either
      of these kinds of platforms will generate the same bytes in the
      CBOR data items created from that input.  (Platforms that use just
      a CARRIAGE RETURN to signify an end of line are no longer relevant
      and the files they produce are out of scope for this document.)
      If a carriage return is needed in the CBOR data item, it can be
      added explicitly using the escaped form \r.

   *  decnumber stands for an integer in the usual decimal notation,
      unless at least one of the optional parts starting with "." and
      "e" are present, in which case it stands for a floating point
      value in the usual decimal notation.  Note that the grammar now
      allows 3. for 3.0 and .3 for 0.3 (also for hexadecimal floating
      point below); implementers are advised that some platform numeric
      parsers accept only a subset of the floating point syntax in this
      document and may require some preprocessing to use here.

   *  hexint, octint, and binint stand for an integer in the usual base
      16/hexadecimal ("0x"), base 8/octal ("0o"), or base 2/binary
      ("0b") notation. hexfloat stands for a floating point number in
      the usual hexadecimal notation (which uses a mantissa in
      hexadecimal and an exponent in decimal notation, see
      Section 5.12.3 of [IEEE754], Section 6.4.4.2 of [C], or
      Section 5.13.4 of [Cplusplus]; floating-suffix/floating-point-
      suffix from the latter two is not used here).

Internet-Draft   CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN)   November 2024


   *  For hexint, octint, binint, and when decnumber stands for an
      integer, the corresponding CBOR data item is represented using
      major type 0 or 1 if possible, or using tag 2 or 3 if not.  In the
      latter case, this specification does not define any encoding
      indicators that apply.  If fine control over encoding is desired,
      this can be expressed by being explicit about the representation
      as a tag: E.g., 987654321098765432310, which is equivalent to
      2(h'35 8a 75 04 38 f3 80 f5 f6') in its preferred serialization,
      might be written as 2_3(h'00 00 00 35 8a 75 04 38 f3 80 f5 f6'_1)
      if leading zeros need to be added during serialization to obtain
      specific sizes for tag head, byte string head, and the overall
      byte string.

      When decnumber stands for a floating point value, and for hexfloat
      and nonfin, a floating point data item with major type 7 is used
      in preferred serialization (unless modified by an encoding
      indicator, which then needs to be _1, _2, or _3).  For this, the
      number range needs to fit into an [IEEE754] binary64 (or the size
      corresponding to the encoding indicator), and the precision will
      be adjusted to binary64 before further applying preferred
      serialization (or to the size corresponding to the encoding
      indicator).  Tag 4/5 representations are not generated in these
      cases.  Future app-prefixes could be defined to allow more control
      for obtaining a tag 4/5 representation directly from a hex or
      decimal floating point literal.

   *  spec stands for an encoding indicator.  See Section 2.2 for
      details.

   *  Extended diagnostic notation allows a (text or byte) string to be
      built up from multiple (text or byte) string literals, separated
      by a + operator; these are then concatenated into a single string.

   string, string1e, string1, and ellipsis realize: (1) the
   representation of strings in this form split up into multiple chunks,
   and (2) the use of ellipses to represent elisions (Section 4.2).

   Note that the syntax defined here for concatenation of components
   uses an explicit + operator between the components to be concatenated
   (Appendix G.4 of [RFC8610] used simple juxtaposition, which was not
   widely implemented and got in the way of making the use of commas
   optional in other places via the rule OC).

   Text strings and byte strings do not mix within such a concatenation,
   except that byte string literal notation can be used inside a
   sequence of concatenated text string notation literals, to encode
   characters that may be better represented in an encoded way.  The
   following four text string values (adapted from Appendix G.4 of
   [RFC8610] by updating to explicit + operators) are equivalent:

     "Hello world"
     "Hello " + "world"
     "Hello" + h'20' + "world"
     "" + h'48656c6c6f20776f726c64' + ""

   Similarly, the following byte string values are equivalent:

     'Hello world'
     'Hello ' + 'world'
     'Hello ' + h'776f726c64'
     'Hello' + h'20' + 'world'
     '' + h'48656c6c6f20776f726c64' + '' + b64''
     h'4 86 56c 6c6f' + h' 20776 f726c64'

   The semantic processing of these constructs is governed by the
   following rules:

   *  A single ... is a general ellipsis, which by itself can stand for
      any data item.  Multiple adjacent concatenated ellipses are
      equivalent to a single ellipsis.

   *  An ellipsis can be concatenated (on one or both sides) with string
      chunks (string1); the result is a CBOR tag number CPA888 that
      contains an array with joined together spans of such chunks plus
      the ellipses represented by 888(null).

   *  If there is no ellipsis in the concatenated list, the result of
      processing the list will always be a single item.

   *  The bytes in the concatenated sequence of string chunks are simply
      joined together, proceeding from left to right.  If the left hand
      side of a concatenation is a text string, the joining operation
      results in a text string, and that result needs to be valid UTF-8.
      If the left hand side is a byte string, the right hand side also
      needs to be a byte string.

   *  Some of the strings may be app-strings.  If the result type of the
      app-string is an actual (text or byte) string, joining of those
      string chunks occurs as with chunks directly notated as string
      literals; otherwise the occurrence of more than one app-string or
      an app-string together with a directly notated string cannot be
      processed.

5.2.  ABNF Definitions for app-string Content

   This subsection provides ABNF definitions for the content of
   application-oriented extension literals defined in [STD94] and in
   this specification.  These grammars describe the _decoded_ content of
   the sqstr components that combine with the application-extension
   identifiers used as prefixes to form application-oriented extension
   literals.  Each of these may make integrate ABNF rules defined in
   Figure 1, which are not always repeated here.

5.2.1.  h: ABNF Definition of Hexadecimal representation of a byte
        string

   The syntax of the content of byte strings represented in hex, such as
   h'', h'0815', or h'/head/ 63 /contents/ 66 6f 6f' (another
   representation of << "foo" >>), is described by the ABNF in Figure 2.
   This syntax accommodates both lower case and upper case hex digits,
   as well as blank space (including comments) around each hex digit.

   app-string-h    = S *(HEXDIG S HEXDIG S / ellipsis S)
                     ["#" *non-lf]
   ellipsis        = 3*"."
   HEXDIG          = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
   DIGIT           = %x30-39 ; 0-9
   blank           = %x09 / %x0A / %x0D / %x20
   non-slash       = blank / %x21-2e / %x30-10FFFF
   non-lf          = %x09 / %x0D / %x20-D7FF / %xE000-10FFFF

5.2.2.  b64: ABNF Definition of Base64 representation of a byte string

   The syntax of the content of byte strings represented in base64 is
   described by the ABNF in Figure 2.

   This syntax allows both the classic (Section 4 of [RFC4648]) and the
   URL-safe (Section 5 of [RFC4648]) alphabet to be used.  It
   accommodates, but does not require base64 padding.  Note that
   inclusion of classic base64 makes it impossible to have in-line
   comments in b64, as "/" is valid base64-classic.

   app-string-b64  = B *(4(b64dig B))
                     [b64dig B b64dig B ["=" B "=" / b64dig B ["="]] B]

5.2.3.  dt: ABNF Definition of RFC 3339 Representation of a Date/Time

   The syntax of the content of dt literals can be described by the ABNF
   for date-time from [RFC3339] as summarized in Section 3 of [RFC9165]:

   app-string-dt   = date-time

   date-fullyear   = 4DIGIT

5.2.4.  ip: ABNF Definition of Textual Representation of an IP Address

   The syntax of the content of ip literals can be described by the ABNF
   for IPv4address and IPv6address in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC3986], as
   included in slightly updated form in Figure 5.

   app-string-ip = IPaddress ["/" uint]

6.1.  CBOR Diagnostic Notation Application-extension Identifiers
      Registry

   IANA is requested to create an "Application-Extension Identifiers"
   registry in a new "CBOR Diagnostic Notation" registry group
   [IANA.cbor-diagnostic-notation], with the policy "expert review"
   (Section 4.5 of RFC 8126 [BCP26]).

   The experts are instructed to be frugal in the allocation of
   application-extension identifiers that are suggestive of generally
   applicable semantics, keeping them in reserve for application-
   extensions that are likely to enjoy wide use and can make good use of
   their conciseness.  The expert is also instructed to direct the
   registrant to provide a specification (Section 4.6 of RFC 8126
   [BCP26]), but can make exceptions, for instance when a specification
   is not available at the time of registration but is likely
   forthcoming.  If the expert becomes aware of application-extension
   identifiers that are deployed and in use, they may also initiate a
   registration on their own if they deem such a registration can avert
   potential future collisions.

   Each entry in the registry must include:

   Application-Extension Identifier:
      a lower case ASCII [STD80] string that starts with a letter and
      can contain letters and digits after that ([a-z][a-z0-9]*).  No
      other entry in the registry can have the same application-
      extension identifier.

   Description:
      a brief description

   Change Controller:
      (see Section 2.3 of RFC 8126 [BCP26])

   Reference:
      a reference document that provides a description of the
      application-extension identifier

   The initial content of the registry is shown in Table 1; all initial
   entries have the Change Controller "IETF".

6.2.  Encoding Indicators

   IANA is requested to create an "Encoding Indicators" registry in the
   newly created "CBOR Diagnostic Notation" registry group [IANA.cbor-
   diagnostic-notation], with the policy "specification required"
   (Section 4.6 of RFC 8126 [BCP26]).

   The experts are instructed to be frugal in the allocation of encoding
   indicators that are suggestive of generally applicable semantics,
   keeping them in reserve for encoding indicator registrations that are
   likely to enjoy wide use and can make good use of their conciseness.
   If the expert becomes aware of encoding indicators that are deployed
   and in use, they may also solicit a specification and initiate a
   registration on their own if they deem such a registration can avert
   potential future collisions.

   Each entry in the registry must include:

   Encoding Indicator:

7.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [STD94] and [RFC8610] apply.

   The EDN specification provides two explicit extension points,
   application-extension identifiers (Section 6.1) and encoding
   indicators (Section 6.2).  Extensions introduced this way can have
   their own security considerations (see, e.g., Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-e-ref]).  When implementing tools that support the
   use of EDN extensions, the implementer needs to be careful not to
   inadvertently introduce a vector for an attacker to invoke extensions
   not planned for by the tool operator, who might not have considered
   security considerations of specific extensions such as those posed by
   their use of dereferenceable identifiers (Section 6 of
   [I-D.bormann-t2trg-deref-id]).  For instance, tools might require
   explicitly enabling the use of each extension that is not on an
   allowlist.  This task can possibly be made less onerous by combining
   it with a mechanism for supplying any parameters controlling such an
   extension.

Appendix A.  EDN and CDDL

   This appendix is for information.

   EDN was designed as a language to provide a human-readable
   representation of an instance, i.e., a single CBOR data item or CBOR
   sequence.  CDDL was designed as a language to describe an (often
   large) set of such instances (which itself constitutes a language),
   in the form of a _data definition_ or _grammar_ (or sometimes called
   _schema_).

   The two languages share some similarities, not the least because they
   have mutually inspired each other.  But they have very different
   roots:

   *  EDN syntax is an extension to JSON syntax [STD90].  (Any
      (interoperable) JSON text is also valid EDN.)

   *  CDDL syntax is inspired by ABNF's syntax [STD68].

   For engineers that are using both EDN and CDDL, it is easy to write
   "CDDLisms" or "EDNisms" into their drafts that are meant to be in the
   other language.  (This is one more of the many motivations to always
   validate formal language instances with tools.)

   Important differences include:

   *  Comment syntax.  CDDL inherits ABNF's semicolon-delimited end of
      line characters, while EDN finds nothing in JSON that could be
      inherited here.  Inspired by JavaScript, EDN simplifies
      JavaScript's copy of the original C comment syntax to be delimited
      by single slashes (where line breaks are not of interest); it also
      adds end-of-line comments starting with #.

      EDN:
         { / alg / 1: -7 / ECDSA 256 / }
         ,
         { 1:   # alg
             -7 # ECDSA 256
         }
      CDDL:  ? 1 => int / tstr, ; algorithm identifier

   *  Syntax for tags.  CDDL's tag syntax is part of the system for
      referring to CBOR's fundamentals (the major type 6, in this case)
      and (with [I-D.ietf-cbor-update-8610-grammar]) allows specifying
      the actual tag number separately, while EDN's tag syntax is a
      simple decimal number and a pair of parentheses.

      EDN:
         98([h'', # empty encoded protected header
             {},  # empty unprotected header
             ...  # rest elided here
            ])

      CDDL:  COSE_Sign_Tagged = #6.98(COSE_Sign)

   *  Embedded CBOR.  EDN has a special syntax to describe the content
      of byte strings that are encoded CBOR data items.  CDDL can
      specify these with a control operator, which looks very different.
